# Breaking Changes in `ng-hub-ui-modal`

This document details the breaking changes of `ng-hub-ui-modal` and how to migrate your codebase.

The major version tracks the Angular major this library targets, so it cannot also signal a break: a
breaking change ships in a **minor** release and is announced here. This file — not the version
number — is the warning.

## [22.12.0] - 2026-09-13

### Projected header nodes move into `.hub-modal__heading`

- **Change**: the nodes `headerSelector` projects are children of a new element,
  `.hub-modal__heading`, instead of direct children of `.hub-modal__header`. The header now holds two
  children, always in this order: the heading, then the close button. The heading is a flex box that
  takes the room the button leaves, and its defaults lay the nodes out the way the header did, in a
  centred row spaced by `--hub-modal-header-gap`.

- **Impact 1 — selectors on the header's direct children stop matching.** `.hub-modal__header > h5`,
  `.hub-modal__header > :first-child` and the like no longer reach a projected node, because the
  header's first child is now the heading. Descendant selectors are unaffected, which is why the
  library's own `.hub-modal__header .modal-title` and `.hub-modal__header .hub-modal__title` keep
  working. The same applies to scripts and tests that walk the header's `children` or read its
  `firstElementChild`.

- **Impact 2 — flex properties on a projected node now resolve inside the heading.** The node is a
  flex item of the heading, so it no longer shares a line with the close button, and auto margins
  are where that shows. A title with `margin-right: auto` or an action with `margin-left: auto`
  (Bootstrap's `ms-auto`) used to split the free space with the close button's own
  `margin-left: auto`, which left the action somewhere in the middle of the header. The heading takes
  all of that space now, so the action ends up at the far end, next to the close button: on an `lg`
  dialog with a title and one button, measured in Chromium, the button moved 189px to the right. For
  the same reason `order` can no longer put a node after the close button, and `align-self` aligns a
  node within the heading rather than the header.

- **Impact 3 — right to left, the close button moves to the far end.** It used to stay next to the
  title, because its `margin-left: auto` took the free space on the side that, in RTL, faces the end
  of the header. It now sits at the end, as it does left to right.

- **If you do nothing**: a header outside the three cases above renders as it did. Rendered in
  Chromium against the previous stylesheet, twelve configurations kept every box within half a pixel:
  a lone `modal-title` or `hub-modal__title`, a lone title carrying its own `margin-right: auto`, a
  title with a badge and a button at the default and the `lg` size, a title that wraps, a title with
  its subtitle, the two of them wrapped in one `<div>`, a `danger` variant, a 2rem header gap, a
  fullscreen dialog and a header with nothing projected into it. A selector from Impact 1 simply
  stops matching; nothing throws.

- **Migration**:

    1. Search your styles and tests for `hub-modal__header >`. Retarget each rule to
       `.hub-modal__heading > …`, or drop the `>` if a descendant selector is what you meant.
    2. Look for auto margins, `order` or `align-self` on anything you project into the header,
       Bootstrap's `ms-auto` and `me-auto` included, and check that the result is still the layout you
       want. Actions grouped at the end, next to the close button, usually are.
    3. If you had moved a subtitle out of the header to keep it from squeezing the title, you can move
       it back: `--hub-modal-heading-direction: column` on your window class stacks it under the title.
       The README shows it with the other three variables.

- **Why**: as long as the projected nodes were flex items of the header, no variable could lay them
  out apart from the close button. A subtitle always sat beside its title and pushed it onto two
  lines, and the only way out was taking the subtitle out of the header altogether. A box of their
  own is what lets a variable decide their direction, gap and alignment.

## [22.11.0] - 2026-09-06

### Announced: `HubModalModule` is removed in 23.0.0

- **Change**: the class is now marked `@deprecated`. Nothing is removed here and nothing changes at
  runtime — this release is the notice, and the removal lands in 23.0.0, the next version that tracks
  a new Angular major.
- **Impact**: from 23.0.0 the symbol is gone from the entry point, so `import { HubModalModule }`
  and `imports: [HubModalModule]` stop compiling.
- **Migration**: delete the import and inject `HubModal`. The module's whole body is
  `providers: [HubModal]`, and the service is `providedIn: 'root'`, so it is already reachable from
  anywhere; the module only added a second instance in whichever injector declared the import,
  delegating to the same root `HubModalStack` and `HubModalConfig`.

    ```ts
    // Before
    @NgModule({ imports: [HubModalModule] })
    export class AppModule {}

    // After — no import at all
    export class OrdersComponent {
    	readonly #modal = inject(HubModal);
    }
    ```

## [22.10.0] - 2026-09-05

### Custom-property defaults moved from `:root` to `:where(.hub-modal)`

This partially reverses [22.8.0](#2280---2026-09-02), released three days earlier, and it is worth
saying so plainly: that release put the defaults on `:root` to stop the library out-ranking your
own `.hub-modal { … }` rule, and it did stop it — at the price of a second, larger defect. This one
keeps the win and drops the price.

- **Change**: every default the library declares is now declared on `:where(.hub-modal)` — the
  dialog element itself, matched through a zero-specificity wrapper. Six tokens stay on `:root`,
  and only those: `--hub-modal-zindex`, `--hub-modal-backdrop-zindex`, `--hub-modal-backdrop-bg`,
  `--hub-modal-backdrop-opacity`, `--hub-modal-backdrop-opacity-hidden` and
  `--hub-modal-backdrop-transition`. No value changes as part of *this* move; the one default
  whose value does change in 22.10.0 is `--hub-modal-accent-bar-width`, and it has its own
  section below.

- **Impact 1 — `:root`-level theming of `--hub-modal-*` stops working.** If you assigned a token
  on `:root`, `html` or `body`, the library's own element-level default now wins: the dialog reads
  what is declared on itself before it reads anything inherited. Under 22.8.0 that assignment was
  a coin flip anyway — same element, same specificity, decided by source order, and the library's
  sheet is injected at runtime so it always landed last — but if it happened to be working for
  you, it has stopped.

    Every documented path still works, and now works better: a `.hub-modal { … }` rule in your own
    sheet, a `windowClass` you pass to `HubModal.open()`, a `hub-modal-window { … }` rule, or the
    `hub-modal-theme()` mixin included on any of them. All four match the dialog element, and
    `:where()` contributes zero specificity, so a single class — even a bare element selector —
    beats the default whatever the source order.

- **Impact 2 — the footer of a dialog carrying a `variant` changes colour.** It used to stay white
  under an accent-tinted body; it now takes the tint, because `--hub-modal-footer-bg` derives from
  `--hub-modal-bg` and a variant re-bases `--hub-modal-bg`. This is the second half of the defect
  being fixed, and it is the only rendering the _move_ alters: 19,470 computed properties were
  compared across 81 dialog configurations plus the backdrop, and exactly 18 differ — all of them
  that footer background. (64 differ once the accent-bar change below is counted too.)

- **Impact 3 — the stacking pair is the one thing that still will not follow the dialog, and you
  should know it rather than find it.** `--hub-modal-backdrop-zindex` derives from
  `--hub-modal-zindex`, and both stay on `:root`, so raising `--hub-modal-zindex` on `.hub-modal`
  moves the window and leaves the backdrop behind — measured at 3000 against 1054. Nothing about
  this release caused it and no declaration site can fix it: `.hub-modal__backdrop` is a **sibling**
  of the dialog, and two siblings cannot share a value through inheritance. Set the stacking order
  on `:root`, which both elements descend from, or give the backdrop its own token through
  `backdropClass`.

### The accent bar above a `variant` dialog is gone unless you ask for it

- **Change**: `--hub-modal-accent-bar-width` now defaults to `0` instead of
  `var(--hub-ref-space-1, 0.25rem)`. A dialog opened with a `variant` no longer draws the coloured
  stripe along the top of its content.

- **Impact**: every `variant` dialog loses the bar and becomes 3px shorter. Its meaning is still
  carried, and carried three times over — the accent-tinted surface, the outer and header/footer
  borders, and the title colour. Nothing else about `variant` changed.

    The bar is also drawn differently: it is a layer on `.hub-modal__content` rather than that
    element's `border-top`. As a border it replaced the dialog's own top edge, so switching it
    off would have left a tinted box with three borders and an open top; as a layer it costs no
    height and leaves the frame alone. If you overrode `border-top` on `.hub-modal__content` to
    suppress the bar, that override is now redundant.

- **Migration**: if you want the bar, turn it back on. The assignment has to land on the dialog,
  because that is where the token is declared and an inherited value loses to it. `.hub-modal`
  reaches every dialog in the application; a `windowClass` reaches only the ones you open with it.
  An assignment on `:root` does nothing, which is the same rule Impact 1 describes four paragraphs
  above.

    ```scss
    .hub-modal {
    	--hub-modal-accent-bar-width: 0.25rem;
    }
    ```

    If you had _suppressed_ the bar yourself — setting the token to `0`, or overriding
    `border-top` on `.hub-modal__content` — that declaration is now redundant and can go.

- **Why**: the bar was the loudest part of a variant and the part nobody chose. It competed with
  whatever the host application had already placed at the top of its own chrome, and it was the
  one piece of the accent system that could not be expressed as a token value — it was a border
  the library drew whether or not the design called for it. Zero is a default anybody can change;
  a hard-coded stripe was not.

- **Migration**:

    1. Search your styles for `--hub-modal-`. Any assignment sitting on `:root`, `html` or `body`
       has to move to a selector that matches the dialog: `.hub-modal`, `hub-modal-window`, or the
       class you pass as `windowClass`. The six backdrop-and-stacking tokens listed above are
       the only ones that still belong on `:root`.
    2. Anything already written on the dialog element needs no change — but read it again before
       you ship, because tokens **derived** from what you assigned now follow it. A
       `--hub-modal-padding-x` you set and then compensated for on the header, a
       `--hub-modal-bg` you set and then restated on the footer: both halves now take effect and
       the compensation may double up.
    3. If you use `variant` and had restated `--hub-modal-footer-bg` to paper over the white
       strip, that declaration still wins and is now redundant. Delete it or keep it — it will not
       fight the library either way.

- **Why**: a custom property is substituted on the element where it is **declared**. On `:root`,
  every token this library derives from another — the header's padding from `--hub-modal-padding-x`,
  the title's colour from `--hub-modal-color`, the accent roles from `--hub-modal-accent`, the
  placement radii from `--hub-modal-border-radius` — resolved against the root's values and reached
  the dialog already cooked. Assigning the parent token on the dialog moved the parent and nothing
  else: a `--hub-modal-padding-x: 3rem` left the header at 16px, a dark `--hub-modal-bg` left the
  footer white, and a `warning` variant on a green-branded product drew a yellow bar and a yellow
  title over a green tint. `:where()` is what makes the element the right place for them: it matches
  the dialog and contributes no specificity, so the derivation resolves locally **and** your own
  rule still wins.

## [22.8.0] - 2026-09-02

### Custom-property defaults moved from `.hub-modal` to `:root`

- **Change**: every default this library declares — `--hub-modal-width`,
  `--hub-modal-placement-end-margin`, and the rest — is now declared on `:root` instead of on
  `.hub-modal`. The values are identical; only where they are declared changed.
- **Impact**: a `.hub-modal { --hub-modal-… : … }` rule in your own stylesheet **now applies**
  where before it was silently ignored. That is the point of the change, and it is still a change
  in rendering: if you wrote such a rule, found it had no effect, and compensated somewhere else,
  both now take effect and the compensation may double up.
- **Migration**: search your styles for `--hub-modal-` and check each assignment is still the value
  you want, now that it is being read. Anything already written at a higher specificity — a
  `.hub-modal.hub-modal--placement-end` block, which is what this library forced people into —
  keeps winning and needs no change, though it can now be flattened to one class.
- **`offcanvas` is not part of this.** It is additive and defaults to `false`; a dialog opened with
  `placement` alone renders exactly as it did, which a spec pins.
- **Why**: this stylesheet is injected at runtime, so at equal specificity it always landed after a
  consumer's sheet and won by order. Assigning a token — the composition doctrine's own
  instruction — did nothing unless you out-specified the primitive. Declaring the defaults one
  level up trades a fight nobody can win for inheritance, which the closer declaration beats
  regardless of order.

## [22.4.0] - 2026-07-07

### SCSS ships at `ng-hub-ui-modal/styles` (packaging path)

- **Change**: the theming mixin now builds to `dist/modal/styles/...` instead of `dist/modal/src/lib/styles/...`, and a `styles/index.scss` root entry forwards it.
- **Impact**: a `@use` that reached into the old `src/lib/styles/...` path no longer resolves.
- **Migration**: `@use 'ng-hub-ui-modal/styles' as *;`

## [22.2.0] - 2026-06-26

### `zindex` tokens lost their hyphen

- **Change**: `--hub-modal-z-index` is now `--hub-modal-zindex`, and `--hub-modal-backdrop-z-index`
  is now `--hub-modal-backdrop-zindex`, matching the `--hub-sys-zindex-*` convention the rest of
  the design system already used. The old names are not read any more.
- **Impact**: this is the quietest kind of break there is. A custom property nobody reads raises no
  error and leaves no warning: a host that had raised the stacking order to sit above its own
  chrome simply went back to the library's default, and the only symptom is a dialog appearing
  behind something it used to cover.
- **Migration**: search your styles for `--hub-modal-z-index` and `--hub-modal-backdrop-z-index`
  and drop the hyphen from `z-index` in each. Both stay declared on `:root`, because the backdrop
  is a sibling of the dialog and cannot inherit from it.

## Version 22.1.0

### Removed shorthand CSS tokens (`--hub-modal-close-padding`, `--hub-modal-title-margin`)

The uniform shorthand tokens that set padding/margin equally on every side have been removed in favour of the canonical directional `-x` / `-y` token pairs used across the design system. This change is purely token-level — there is **no visual change** for the default modal.

**Removed:**

- `--hub-modal-close-padding`
- `--hub-modal-title-margin`

**Migration Steps:**
If you set either of the removed shorthands in your global stylesheets or theme layer, replace each one with its directional `-x` / `-y` pair:

- `--hub-modal-close-padding: <value>;` becomes `--hub-modal-close-padding-x: <value>; --hub-modal-close-padding-y: <value>;`
- `--hub-modal-title-margin: <value>;` becomes `--hub-modal-title-margin-x: <value>; --hub-modal-title-margin-y: <value>;`

> The dialog's per-side margin system — `--hub-modal-margin-x` / `--hub-modal-margin-y` plus the placement margins — is **unchanged**.

## Version 21.0.0

### Modal CSS BEM Standardization

To avoid conflicts with Bootstrap's core CSS classes and external stylesheets, all internal CSS classes rendered by the `ng-hub-ui-modal` structural components (Window and Backdrop) have been prefixed and standardized to the BEM (Block Element Modifier) convention using the `hub-modal` prefix.

**Migration Steps:**
If you have written any custom CSS or SCSS in your global stylesheets targeting the modal's internal DOM structure (e.g. `.modal-dialog`, `.modal-content`, `.modal-backdrop`), you must update your selectors:

- `.modal` becomes `.hub-modal`
- `.modal-dialog` becomes `.hub-modal__dialog`
- `.modal-content` becomes `.hub-modal__content`
- `.modal-header` becomes `.hub-modal__header`
- `.modal-body` becomes `.hub-modal__body`
- `.modal-footer` becomes `.hub-modal__footer`
- `.modal-backdrop` becomes `.hub-modal__backdrop`
- Buttons/Close elements such as `.btn-close` become `.hub-modal__close`
