# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The repository moved to the `hub-env` organization. Issues for every Hub UI package are now
  gathered in [hub-env/hub-ui](https://github.com/hub-env/hub-ui/issues), and the `repository`, `bugs`
  and README links point at the new addresses. GitHub redirects the old ones.

## [22.12.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **The nodes projected into the header get a box of their own, laid out by four new variables.**
  Whatever `headerSelector` brings in now lands in `.hub-modal__heading`, which sits before the
  close button and takes the room the button leaves. The box reads `--hub-modal-heading-direction`
  (default `row`), `--hub-modal-heading-align-items` (`center`) and `--hub-modal-heading-gap` (the
  header's own gap), and the header itself now reads `--hub-modal-header-align-items` (`center`).
  Setting `column` on the window class stacks a subtitle under its title, and `flex-start` on the
  header pins the close button to the top of that two-line heading. Neither was possible before: the
  projected nodes were flex items of the header, so a subtitle sat beside its title and squeezed it
  onto two lines, and no variable could move it.

### Changed

- **Projected header nodes sit one level deeper in the DOM.** They are children of
  `.hub-modal__heading` now, not of `.hub-modal__header`, and the close button is always the
  header's last child. With the defaults nothing moves: twelve header configurations rendered in
  Chromium against the previous stylesheet kept every box within half a pixel. What does move is
  listed in `BREAKING_CHANGES.md` — selectors written against the header's direct children, and auto
  margins on a projected node, which now resolve inside the heading and push that node to the end,
  next to the close button.

### Fixed

- **In a right-to-left document the close button sat next to the title.** Its `margin-left: auto`
  takes the free space on its left, and right to left that is the side facing the end of the header,
  so the button never reached the end. The heading now takes that space and the button sits at the
  far end in either direction. A title too long to wrap, such as a URL, also stops pushing the button
  past the edge of the dialog.

## [22.11.1] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **`ng-hub-ui-ds` is declared as an optional peer dependency.** The stylesheet reads twenty-one
  distinct `--hub-sys-*` and `--hub-ref-*` tokens across eighty-six references, and until now the
  manifest said nothing about where they come from: a consumer installing the modal on its own got the fallback values and no hint that a
  shared palette exists. `peerDependenciesMeta` marks it optional, exactly as `ng-hub-ui-panels`
  already does, so nothing warns a project that themes on its own — every token this library reads
  is written with its own fallback. Install metadata only; no code changes.

- **Both READMEs state where this library stands on server-side rendering.** The honest answer is
  «not verified»: a dialog only exists after a gesture, so the site's prerender — which is the
  running proof for the libraries that render markup on the page — never draws one.

### Changed

- **`HubModalBackdrop` no longer declares `ViewEncapsulation.None`.** It has `template: ''` and no
  stylesheet of its own, so the setting had nothing to leak and nothing to protect; the rules that
  dress `.hub-modal__backdrop` are emitted from `HubModalWindow`, which does declare it. Removing
  a style-encapsulation override from a component with no styles changes nothing at runtime.

- **`HubModalWindow` says why it leaves style encapsulation**, as `CODING_RULES.md` requires of
  every exception. Reason 1: most of that stylesheet dresses elements outside the window's own
  view — `body.hub-modal-open`, the `:root` block the backdrop reads, and `.hub-modal__backdrop`
  itself, a sibling component rather than a descendant — none of which can ever carry the window's
  marker attribute.

## [22.11.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **`closeAriaLabel`: the dismiss button the library draws can finally be named in the
  application's own language.** That button carries no text — its glyph is painted by CSS — so its
  `aria-label` is the entire name a screen reader reads out, and it was the literal `"Close"`,
  written into the template. A localized application therefore shipped one control it had no way
  to translate, and it is not an edge case: that header is what the library builds whenever
  `headerSelector` or `footerSelector` is set.

    The option follows the shape every other option here already has — `closeAriaLabel` on
    `HubModalOptions`, with its default on `HubModalConfig`, so it can be set once for the whole
    application or per call. It still defaults to `"Close"`, so nothing changes for an application
    that says nothing.

### Changed

- **`modal-stack.ts` no longer dresses the component host with `component-host-scrollable`.**
  That element is only a query root: `splitIntoSlots` takes its children into the window and the
  host itself never enters the document, and this library ships no rule for the class either — so
  the line had no effect on anything a consumer can see. `scrollable` reaches the dialog through
  `hub-modal__dialog--scrollable`, set in `HubModalWindow`, and keeps working exactly as before.
  The old `FIXME` that asked for this is replaced by a note saying why the host cannot be styled,
  so the class does not come back.

- Internal hygiene in the same file, with no change in behaviour: the JSDoc of
  `extractAndRemoveNodesBySelector` moved from above `splitIntoSlots` — where it described a
  function it did not belong to — down onto its own; a `const` bound to the `void` return of
  `addEventListener` was dropped; the selector was queried twice in a row to remove what had just
  been read, and now the single result is reused; and the two remaining Spanish comments, which
  only restated the line under them, are gone.

- **`HubModalWindow` and `HubModalBackdrop` now declare `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.** Both read
  their template values from signal inputs, and `HubModalRef` updates them through
  `ComponentRef.setInput`, which marks the view itself — so neither ever needed a check it had not
  been marked for. Angular 22 already treats a component that names no strategy as OnPush, so nothing
  changes for an application on the current major; the declaration is what carries the strategy into
  the published package, compiled in partial mode for a peer range that still admits Angular 18, whose
  linker resolves an unstated strategy to `Eager`.

### Deprecated

- **`HubModalModule`, marked for removal in 23.0.0.** The class carried no `@deprecated` tag, so an
  editor gave no hint and neither did the build: a consumer had no way of learning the module was on
  its way out before it stopped existing. It now says so. Its whole body is `providers: [HubModal]`,
  and `HubModal` is `providedIn: 'root'` — so importing the module never enabled the service, it
  added a redundant second instance in whichever injector declared the import, delegating to the
  same root `HubModalStack` and `HubModalConfig`. Inject `HubModal` and drop the import; nothing
  else changes. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

### Fixed

- **`BREAKING_CHANGES.md` promised its breaks in major versions.** The preamble read "breaking
  changes introduced in major versions", which this library cannot deliver: its major tracks the
  Angular major it targets, so a break arrives inside a minor — as 22.8.0 and 22.10.0 both did, two
  entries down the same file. A reader taking the preamble at its word had every reason to skip the
  file on a minor upgrade, which is exactly when it matters.

- **The documentation described an API this library does not have.** Both READMEs opened with
  "zero external dependencies" while four files import from `ng-hub-ui-utils` and the manifest
  declares it as a peer, so the install instructions left a reader one unresolved import short of
  a build. `offcanvas` was missing from the English options table and from both
  `HubModalUpdatableOptions` lists, which reads as "a drawer cannot be toggled on an open dialog";
  the Spanish table was missing `ariaLabelledBy`, `ariaDescribedBy` and `bodySelector` on top of
  it, and the Spanish API reference had no `HubActiveModal`, `ModalDismissReasons`,
  `HubModalConfig` or BEM class sections at all. All of it now matches `modal-config.ts`.

- **The `zindex` rename shipped in 22.2.0 had no migration entry.** `--hub-modal-z-index` became
  `--hub-modal-zindex` and `--hub-modal-backdrop-z-index` became `--hub-modal-backdrop-zindex`,
  and a custom property nobody reads raises no error — so a host that had set the old names lost
  them in silence, with a dialog sliding behind its own chrome as the only symptom.
  `BREAKING_CHANGES.md` now carries that section, where it belonged since June.

## [22.10.0] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **`HubModal.open()` with a plain string opened an empty dialog that the keyboard could not
  close.** Every other kind of content goes through `splitIntoSlots`, which returns the three
  slots `attachContent` destructures — `[header, body, footer]`. The string path did not: it
  returned a single slot, so the text was appended to the **header** and the body arrived
  `undefined`. Appending it threw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
'forEach')` part-way through the open sequence, before the window reached
  `_enableEventHandling()`. The dialog rendered blank, with no content and no close button, and
  <kbd>Esc</kbd> did nothing because no listener had been attached — leaving the backdrop click
  as the only way out.

    The string now goes into the body slot like everything else. Three specs pin it, in
    `modal-string-content.spec.ts`: the text lands in the body, nothing lands in the header, and
    the call does not throw.

    This is the second time <kbd>Esc</kbd> has stopped working for a reason that had nothing to
    do with the keyboard — 22.4.1 was the first, when `NgZone.onStable` never emitted in a
    zoneless app and the listener was likewise never attached. Both share a shape worth naming:
    the handler is armed at the tail of a sequence that can quietly fail to finish.

- **A `--hub-modal-*` token a consumer set on the dialog did not reach anything derived from it.**
  This is one defect with a long tail, and the narrow symptom that surfaced it — a `warning`
  dialog painted half in the host's brand colour — was the least of it.

    A custom property is substituted on the element where it is **declared**, not where the
    value is finally used. Every default this library ships was declared on `:root`, and a good
    third of them are derived from another `--hub-modal-*` token: the header's padding from
    `--hub-modal-padding-x`, the footer's background from `--hub-modal-bg`, the title's colour
    from `--hub-modal-color`, the inner and placement radii from `--hub-modal-border-radius`,
    the whole margin family from `--hub-modal-margin-y`, the four accent roles from
    `--hub-modal-accent`. All of them resolved against the **root's** values and reached the
    dialog already cooked, so a declaration on the dialog itself re-based the parent token and
    nothing downstream of it moved.

    Measured in Chrome, on the real DOM, before and after:

    | Written on `.hub-modal`           | Before                                | After          |
    | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
    | `--hub-modal-padding-x: 3rem`     | header stayed at 16px                 | 48px           |
    | `--hub-modal-margin-y: 5rem`      | dialog stayed at 28px                 | 80px           |
    | `--hub-modal-bg: #1f1714`         | footer stayed white                   | follows        |
    | `--hub-modal-color: #f8efe7`      | `--hub-modal-title-color` was #212529 | follows        |
    | `--hub-modal-border-radius: 1rem` | placement radius stayed at 8px        | 16px           |
    | `--hub-modal-accent: #efc900`     | the roles kept the host's brand green | derive from it |

    The reported symptom was the last row. On a product whose company colour is olive green,
    `.hub-modal--warning` re-pointed `--hub-modal-accent` and got a yellow top bar and a yellow
    title over a background and two borders still mixed from `#6b8e23` — a warning that warned
    in green. The accent measured `#efc900` while `--hub-modal-accent-subtle` was still mixing
    the brand.

    The defaults now live on `:where(.hub-modal)`, which is the dialog element itself, so every
    link of every chain resolves against the value that won **on that element** — a variant
    class, a `windowClass`, or the consumer's own rule. See _Changed_ below for what that costs.

- **The open-set escape hatch documented in the stylesheet was false, and now is not.** The
  comment above the variant loop has promised since 22.2.0 that any custom accent — a `brand`
  the host adds to the ds `$hub-accents` map — recolours a whole dialog with one rule that only
  re-bases `--hub-modal-accent`, no recompilation needed. It never did: the roles it relies on
  were declared on `:root` and had already resolved there. That rule now works exactly as
  written, and the comment says so:

    ```scss
    .hub-modal--brand {
    	--hub-modal-accent: var(--hub-sys-color-brand);
    	--hub-modal-bg: var(--hub-modal-accent-subtle);
    	--hub-modal-border-color: var(--hub-modal-accent-border);
    	--hub-modal-title-color: var(--hub-modal-accent);
    }
    ```

- **A `variant` whose design-system colour the host had not defined emptied the accent instead
  of falling back.** Each variant read `var(--hub-sys-color-<v>, var(--hub-modal-accent))`, and a
  custom property that names itself inside its own value is a cycle — invalid at computed-value
  time, not a fallback. On a host that ships some of the nine `--hub-sys-color-*` but not all,
  `variant: 'neutral'` left `--hub-modal-accent` empty and took `-subtle`, `-emphasis`, `-on` and
  `-border` down with it, so the dialog rendered with no accent at all and no error anywhere. The
  fallback now names the brand — `var(--hub-sys-color-<v>, var(--hub-sys-color-primary, #0d6efd))`
  — so a missing variant colour degrades to the brand accent and the roles still derive.

- **`--hub-modal-title-color` reached a title classed `hub-modal__title`.** The rule that reads
  it matched `.modal-title` alone — the name from when this library sat on top of Bootstrap, and
  the name every example in the documentation still writes. A consumer who never used Bootstrap
  wrote the house name, read the token in the README, and got nothing. Both class names are
  matched now. Neither is going away: the heading is authored by the caller, not by this
  library, so it cannot simply be renamed.

### Changed

- **The accent bar above a `variant` dialog is off by default.** `--hub-modal-accent-bar-width`
  ships at `0` instead of `0.25rem`. The bar was the loudest half of a variant and the half
  nobody asked for: a dialog already reads as `danger` through its tint, its two borders and its
  title, and the stripe mostly competed with whatever the host had put at the top of its own
  chrome. It is one assignment away for anyone who wants it, and the assignment goes on the
  dialog — `.hub-modal` reaches every dialog in the application, a `windowClass` only some.
  Not `:root`: the token is declared on the element, so an inherited value loses to it, which
  is the same rule the rest of this release is about.

    ```scss
    .hub-modal {
    	--hub-modal-accent-bar-width: 0.25rem;
    }
    ```

    The bar is now drawn as a layer on the content rather than as its top border, and that
    correction is worth its own line: as a border it was a _replacement_, so taking the width to
    zero also took away the dialog's own 1px top edge and left a tinted box with three sides and
    an open top. A layer occupies no space at zero height, and turning the bar on no longer
    costs the frame — a `danger` dialog keeps four matching 1px borders either way. The net
    effect is that a variant dialog is 3px shorter than it was.

    If you had overridden `border-top` on `.hub-modal__content` to suppress the bar yourself,
    that override no longer has anything to suppress and can go.

- **The footer of a dialog carrying a `variant` now takes the accent tint instead of staying
  white.** `--hub-modal-footer-bg` derives from `--hub-modal-bg`, and a variant re-bases
  `--hub-modal-bg` to `--hub-modal-accent-subtle`; before, the footer read the root's white and
  the dialog ended with a tinted body sitting on a white strip. This is the defect above being
  corrected rather than a decision, and it is the only rendering this release changes that
  nobody chose — the accent bar below was chosen.

    Pinned by measurement, not by inspection: 19,470 computed properties compared across 81
    dialog configurations — nine window variants against nine dialog variants — plus the
    backdrop, old stylesheet against new. Exactly 64 differ, and every one of them is one of
    the two decisions in this section: 18 are that footer background, and 46 are the accent bar
    standing down — 16 top-border widths going from the bar's 4px back to the dialog's own 1px,
    16 top-border colours going from the accent back to the accent-tinted border the other three
    sides use, and the 14 dialog heights that are 3px shorter for it.
    The default dialog, every size, `centered`, `scrollable`, `fullscreen`, all four placements,
    `offcanvas` and the backdrop render byte-identically.

    If a consumer compensated for the white strip — a `--hub-modal-footer-bg` of their own on a
    variant dialog — that declaration still wins and needs no change; it is simply no longer
    doing the library's work.

- **The default custom properties moved from `:root` to `:where(.hub-modal)`.** This reverses
  most of what 22.8.0 did three days ago, and keeps what it was for.

    22.8.0 moved the defaults to `:root` because, declared plainly on `.hub-modal`, they beat a
    consumer's own `.hub-modal { … }` rule: the stylesheet is injected at runtime by the window
    component, so it always lands after the consumer's sheet and wins at equal specificity by
    source order. `:root` traded that fight for inheritance and the consumer was read — at the
    price of every derived token resolving one level too high, which is the defect above.

    `:where()` settles both at once. It matches the same element and contributes **zero**
    specificity, so any declaration a consumer writes wins whatever the source order, and the
    values are declared on the dialog, where everything derived from them resolves against what
    actually won there.

    Six tokens stay on `:root`, and they are exactly the ones a sibling reads:
    `--hub-modal-zindex`, `--hub-modal-backdrop-zindex`, `--hub-modal-backdrop-bg`,
    `--hub-modal-backdrop-opacity`, `--hub-modal-backdrop-opacity-hidden` and
    `--hub-modal-backdrop-transition`. `.hub-modal__backdrop` is not a descendant of
    `.hub-modal` and cannot inherit anything declared on it; a stacking order is a
    document-wide decision in any case.

    **And that one pair still does not follow the dialog, which is worth saying plainly rather
    than leaving to be discovered.** `--hub-modal-backdrop-zindex` derives from
    `--hub-modal-zindex`, and both are declared on `:root`, so re-basing `--hub-modal-zindex`
    on `.hub-modal` raises the window and leaves the backdrop where it was — measured at 3000
    against 1054. This is not a leftover of the defect above; two sibling elements cannot share
    a value through inheritance, and no declaration site fixes that. Theme the stacking order on
    `:root`, where both elements can read it, or set the backdrop's own token through
    `backdropClass`. Everything else in this library derives on the dialog and follows it.

    **What this breaks:** a `--hub-modal-*` token assigned on `:root`, `html` or `body` — which
    is what 22.8.0 briefly made viable — now loses to the library's own element-level default.
    Assign on the modal element instead. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

## [22.9.0] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **The dialog no longer opens with the focus on its own close button.**

    The dismiss button is the first focusable element in the window's DOM, so `_setFocus` handed it
    the focus on every open. Two things followed. A destructive confirm opened with the caret on
    «cancel this dialog» rather than on what the dialog asks, which is the one placement the ARIA
    dialog pattern names as the wrong one. And the browser drew its **own** focus ring — blue,
    always — which on a `variant` dialog is a colour from nowhere: measured on a `danger` confirm,
    a blue box sitting across a red header, and read by the consumer as a broken glyph rather than
    as focus. The button is now skipped when choosing where focus lands; `hubAutofocus` still names
    it explicitly for anybody who wants it there, and a dialog with nothing else focusable falls
    through to the dialog element, which carries `tabindex="-1"` for exactly this.

- **The close button's focus ring follows the dialog's accent.** It had no `:focus-visible` rule at
  all, so what showed was the user agent's default. It now draws from `--hub-modal-accent`, which
  every variant already re-bases, and it is `:focus-visible` rather than `:focus` so a mouse click
  does not leave a ring behind. Four new slots — `--hub-modal-close-focus-ring-width`, `-color`,
  `-offset` and `-radius` — for a host that wants another shape.

## [22.8.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **`offcanvas`: a dialog that touches the edge it slid out of.**

    `placement` has always slid a dialog in from an edge, with the animation, the focus trap, the
    backdrop and the escape key. What it never assumed is that a dialog anchored to an edge wants to
    _touch_ it. Measured on a consumer before this existed: a 56px strip of page showing along the
    bottom, because the dialog kept the margins of a floating one; rounded corners on the side it was
    attached to, which reads as a modal somebody placed badly rather than as a drawer; a short panel
    opening as a half-height box hanging off the top edge, because nothing said a dialog should fill
    its container; and a width taken from the modal size scale, where `size: 'lg'` is 800px and on an
    853px window left 53px of the document the drawer is meant to be read _against_ — no context at
    all.

    `offcanvas: true` settles all four: flush against its edge, square on the side it is attached to,
    stretched to the full height (or width, from the top or bottom), with the body scrolling so the
    header and footer stay put, and its own measure through `--hub-modal-offcanvas-width`.

    ```ts
    // A drawer is one decision. With no placement it opens from the end edge.
    this.modal.open(MyComponent, { offcanvas: true });

    // Or name the edge.
    this.modal.open(MyComponent, { offcanvas: true, placement: HubModalPlacement.Start });
    ```

    **Separate from `placement` rather than implied by it.** Making an edge placement mean "drawer"
    would change what every existing consumer of it sees, with nothing to catch it — a silent visual
    break is worse than an extra option. Passing `placement` alone still gives exactly what it gave
    before, and a spec pins that.

    Three tokens come with it, and the scale of sizes deliberately does not reach any of them:
    `--hub-modal-offcanvas-width` (`min(28rem, 100%)`), `--hub-modal-offcanvas-height`
    (`min(60vh, 100%)`, for a sheet from the top or bottom) and `--hub-modal-offcanvas-border-radius`
    (`0` — exposed anyway, because rounding the _far_ side is a real choice).

### Changed

- **The library's default custom properties are declared on `:root`, not on `.hub-modal`.** This is
  a contract repair rather than a detail, and it is what made the option above worth building.

    This stylesheet is injected at runtime by the component, so it always lands after a consumer's own
    sheet. Declared on `.hub-modal`, every default beat a consumer's `.hub-modal { --hub-modal-width: … }`
    at equal specificity by source order alone — so assigning a token, which is exactly what the
    composition doctrine asks a consumer to do, did nothing. The only way through was to out-specify
    the primitive: one consumer had to write `.hub-modal.hub-modal--placement-end` for no reason other
    than to be read. That cannot be the contract.

    On `:root` there is no fight to win. The values reach the dialog by inheritance, and any
    declaration closer to it in the tree wins whatever the source order — so `.hub-modal { … }` in a
    consumer's sheet is now read. Assign on a selector that matches the modal element; a consumer's
    own `:root` block is still the same element and the same specificity as this one, and would lose
    to it on order.

    Nothing a modifier re-bases on the element itself moved: the variant classes still re-point
    `--hub-modal-accent` from `.hub-modal--primary`, and they keep working precisely because an
    element-level declaration outranks an inherited one.

## [22.7.1] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- **The `homepage` in the manifest points at this library's own documentation page** rather than at
  the site root. It is the link a registry shows beside the package and the one a reader clicks from
  it, and landing on a front page they then have to search is a worse answer than landing on the
  reference for the package they were already looking at. Metadata only — no code, no types, no
  styles change, and nothing a consumer imports is affected.

## [22.7.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`bodySelector`: the body becomes a slot with a name.** It was the one part of a modal with no way to point at it — the body was whatever survived the header and the footer being taken out. That holds while the three parts are written in order and the content contains nothing else, and stops holding the moment it does: leftovers are defined by what they are _not_, so a comment, a stray text node or an `<ng-container>` holding state joined the body, and moving a block in the template changed the result.

    Adding it to content that already works cannot lose anything. Whatever the selector matches goes into the body first, and everything unclaimed by any of the three slots follows it — so the option can only reorder, never drop.

    Fixed alongside it, because naming the body is what exposed it: the body used to be read **between** the header and the footer extractions, so the footer's marker element was still a child when the body was captured and an emptied `<div>` rode along into it. All three slots are taken out first now, and what nobody claimed is the body's.

### Fixed

- **Every dialog is bounded by the viewport, and its body is what scrolls.** This was `scrollable`'s job alone, which put the decision in the wrong hands: whether a dialog outgrows the screen depends on its content, on the length of the translation and on the height of the window, and the caller knows none of the three when it opens the thing. A dialog that outgrew the screen simply extended past it, and what falls off the bottom is the footer — so in a wizard it was the "Next" button, unreachable.

    The cap is stated against the viewport (`100dvh` minus `--hub-modal-dialog-inset`) rather than as a percentage of the dialog, because the dialog's own height is `auto` and a percentage against it is not a definite reference. `min-height: 0` on the content and the body is what lets them shrink below their content so `overflow` has something to do — a flex item defaults to `min-height: auto` and refuses to. `--fullscreen` zeroes the inset, since it covers the viewport and has no margin to discount.

    `scrollable` keeps its own rules and its own meaning: it is what pins the dialog itself, and it still says "this dialog expects to scroll".

    **This changes the default.** A consumer that deliberately let a dialog run past the viewport — expecting the page behind it to scroll — now gets a capped dialog with a scrolling body. Raising `--hub-modal-dialog-inset` is not an escape hatch for that; there is none, on purpose.

## [22.6.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **The dialog now travels between heights instead of jumping.** A modal is sized by whatever it holds, so a wizard step, an async panel or a validation message appearing would snap the box to its new height in a single frame.

    Measured rather than assumed, because the obvious repair does not work: the specified height is `auto` before the change and `auto` after it, and a CSS transition only fires when the specified value changes — the content moved, the property did not. `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` does not help either, for the same reason; it interpolates _to_ a keyword, it does not notice a box growing underneath one. In the browser, a content-driven change sampled `200, 200, 200, 200` with it enabled, against `0, 44, 100, 156, 200` for an explicit `0` → `auto`.

    So both heights are measured and animated explicitly, which also behaves identically everywhere rather than only where `interpolate-size` has shipped. Tuned through `--hub-modal-resize-duration` (milliseconds, unitless) and `--hub-modal-resize-easing`, disabled by `[animation]="false"` and by `prefers-reduced-motion`.

    Width already animated and is untouched.

## [22.5.1] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Documentation links now point at the canonical localized URLs. The README linked to `https://hubui.dev/<path>` with no locale prefix and no trailing slash, and both forms are 301-redirected, so every reader arriving from npm or GitHub landed on a redirect instead of the canonical page.

## [22.5.0] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- **Typed modal flows — no more `as unknown as` casts.** `HubModal.open<C, R, D>(content, options)` now infers the content component type from the class you pass (`content: Type<C> | TemplateRef | string`), so `HubModalRef.componentInstance` is typed as the component _instance_ (it used to resolve to the class object type, which forced casts). The new `R` generic types the result flow end to end: `close(result?: R)`, `result: Promise<R>`, `closed: Observable<R>` and `HubActiveModal<D, R>.close(result?: R)`; `HubModalOptions<D>` types the `data` payload, pairing with the existing `HubActiveModal<D>.data`. All generics default to the previous loose types (`any`), so existing call sites compile unchanged; dismiss reasons intentionally stay untyped (internal `ModalDismissReasons` or consumer values).

## [22.4.2] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Declared the real `ng-hub-ui-utils` peer range: `>=22.0.0`. The previous `>=1.0.0` floor allowed resolving a utils major from a different era than the one this library is built and tested against.

## [22.4.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- **Escape and backdrop click did nothing in a zoneless app.** `HubModalWindowComponent` and `HubModalBackdrop` deferred their entry work to `NgZone.onStable`. Under `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` the injected zone is a `NoopNgZone`, whose `onStable` never emits, so that work never ran. For the backdrop this only cost the fade-in; for the window it meant `_show()` — and therefore `_enableEventHandling()` — never executed, leaving **every** modal in a zoneless application unclosable by <kbd>Esc</kbd> or by clicking the backdrop: no listener had ever been attached. Both now defer with `afterNextRender`, which fires in zoneful and zoneless apps alike. No API change.

## [22.4.0] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING (packaging) — SCSS ships at `ng-hub-ui-modal/styles`.** The theme mixin now builds to `dist/modal/styles/...` (was `dist/modal/src/lib/styles/...`), so `@use 'ng-hub-ui-modal/styles'` resolves. Update any `@use` that reached into `src/lib/styles`.

## [22.3.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Typed payload accessor.** A new `HUB_MODAL_DATA` injection token now carries the `HubModalOptions.data` payload to the modal content component, provided in the same element injector as `HubActiveModal`. `HubActiveModal` is now generic (`HubActiveModal<D = unknown>`) and exposes a read-only `data` accessor, so both `inject(HUB_MODAL_DATA)` and `inject(HubActiveModal).data` return the payload in a strongly-typed way (mirroring the Angular CDK `DIALOG_DATA` pattern). Resolves to `null` when no `data` option was supplied. New export: `HUB_MODAL_DATA`.

### Deprecated

- The untyped `Object.assign(componentInstance, { data })` monkey-patch of a `data` field on the content component is deprecated in favour of `HUB_MODAL_DATA` / `HubActiveModal.data`. It is kept for one release for backward compatibility and will be removed in a future major.

## [22.2.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Docs: `docs/css-variables-reference.md` default values resynchronized with the actual code declarations (now guarded by the repo-level `tokens-parity` check F).

## [22.2.0] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- Canonical `zindex` token names (BREAKING): `--hub-modal-z-index` → `--hub-modal-zindex`, `--hub-modal-backdrop-z-index` → `--hub-modal-backdrop-zindex` (no hyphen, matching the `--hub-sys-zindex-*` convention).
- **Accent system migrated to the open-set "local accent slot" pattern.** A modal `variant` now re-bases a single `--hub-modal-accent` slot, and the role family — `--hub-modal-accent-emphasis`, `--hub-modal-accent-subtle`, `--hub-modal-accent-border` and the new `--hub-modal-accent-on` (contrast colour) — is derived **locally** from it with `color-mix(in oklch, …)` / relative color, mirroring the `ng-hub-ui-ds` engine. The built-in variant list grew from 5 to the **nine canonical accents** (`primary · secondary · success · danger · warning · info · neutral · light · dark`). Because the roles re-derive from the slot, **any custom accent** (e.g. a `brand` the host app adds to the ds `$hub-accents` map) recolours the whole dialog with one rule that only re-bases `--hub-modal-accent` — open it with `{ variant: 'brand' }` or `windowClass: 'hub-modal--brand'`, no library recompilation.

### Added

- New token `--hub-modal-accent-on` (grayscale contrast flip driven by the accent's own lightness, ready for accent-filled surfaces) and `--hub-modal-accent-emphasis`.

### Fixed

- Migrated the accent `color-mix()` derivations (`--hub-modal-accent-subtle` / `-border`) from the `srgb` colour space to `oklch` for perceptually uniform tints, matching `ng-hub-ui-ds`. The subtle tint is now derived at 12% (was 8%).

## [22.1.2] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- Corrected the Angular peer dependency range to `>=18.0.0`. The library uses APIs introduced in Angular 17 (signal `input()`/`output()`, the `@if` control flow and/or signal queries), whose real minimum is Angular 17.3, so the previous `>=16.0.0` range was too low and let it install on incompatible versions.
- Corrected the `ng-hub-ui-utils` peer dependency range to `>=1.0.0`. The previous caret range (`^1.x`) resolved to `>=1 <2`, which excluded the current `ng-hub-ui-utils` (22.x) and made the peer impossible to satisfy.

## [22.1.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Design-token consistency pass: aligned inline fallback defaults with the canonical `ng-hub-ui-ds` values and routed hardcoded literals (z-index, font-weight, line-height, radii and theme-aware colours) through their `--hub-sys-*` / `--hub-ref-*` tokens, so they follow the active theme. No visual change when the ds tokens are loaded.

## [22.1.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- New `variant` option on `HubModal.open()` selecting a **semantic accent** for meaningful dialogs: `this.modal.open(Cmp, { variant: 'danger' })`. The built-in values (`primary` / `success` / `danger` / `warning` / `info`) map to the design-system colours, but **any string is accepted** — the modal reads `--hub-sys-color-<variant>` from the host application. A variant recolours the whole dialog: a top accent **bar**, a lightly accent-tinted **background**, accent-tinted **borders** (outer + header/footer rules) and an accent **title**. Defaults to neutral (no accent). The option is also updatable through `HubModalRef.update()` / `HubActiveModal.update()`, and can be applied directly via `windowClass: 'hub-modal--<variant>'`. Mirrors the accent system in panels/nav/table/list/board.
- New **`hub-modal-theme()` Sass mixin** (`styles/mixins/modal-theme`) — theme a dialog in one call: accent, surfaces, colour, title, borders/radius/shadow, header/body/footer padding & gaps, backdrop. Every parameter is optional and defaults to `null`, so only the ones you pass are emitted as `--hub-modal-*` overrides; the rest keep their defaults. Apply it to the class you pass as `windowClass` (or to `.hub-modal` for all dialogs). Token-based, no Bootstrap dependency.
- New tokens: `--hub-modal-accent` (default `--hub-sys-color-primary`), `--hub-modal-accent-subtle` (variant tinted background, generated from the accent with `color-mix`), `--hub-modal-accent-border` (variant accent-tinted border), `--hub-modal-accent-bar-width` (default `--hub-ref-space-1`, 4px) and `--hub-modal-title-color` (default neutral). No visual change for a neutral modal.

### Changed

- Replaced the uniform `--hub-modal-close-padding` and `--hub-modal-title-margin` shorthands with the canonical directional `-x` / `-y` tokens. No visual change. **BREAKING**: set the `-x`/`-y` tokens instead of the removed shorthands. (The dialog's per-side margin system — `--hub-modal-margin-x/-y` + placement margins — is unchanged.)

## [22.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Aligned with Angular 22.
- README documentation standardized.

## [21.0.3] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Guard `parentNode` when removing the modal window and backdrop elements during teardown, preventing a `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'removeChild')` error when an element is already detached.

## [21.0.2] - 2026-03-31

### Changed

- Standardized modal padding variables.

### Fixed

- Improved fullscreen modal layout responsiveness.

## [21.0.1] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- Removed hardcoded design system token defaults (`--hub-ref-*`, `--hub-sys-*`) from the
  component stylesheet. These tokens now rely solely on the host application's design system
  layer; all `--hub-modal-*` variables retain their literal fallback values for standalone usage.

### Fixed

- Fixed `modal-backdrop.spec.ts` tests: added required `animation` input initialization and
  `async`/`await fixture.whenStable()` for proper async test stability.
- Fixed `modal.spec.ts` event subscription ordering: subscribe before emitting to ensure
  handler is registered in time.

## [21.0.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- Implemented a new internal `Select` UI component with full accessibility, proper keyboard handling, and dropdown options.
- Added `HubModalPlacement` configuration and placement CSS classes to support launching modals anchored to specific viewport edges (`start`, `end`, `top`, `bottom`, `center`).
- Added exhaustive CSS Variables documentation for the `modal` component (`docs/css-variables-reference.md`).
- Fully documented the internal library files (`HubModalWindow`, `HubModalStack`, `HubModalBackdrop`, `HubModalPlacement`) using english JSDoc comments.

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Standardized modal CSS class names to the `hub-modal` BEM convention.
- Removed legacy `NgIf` imports to utilize Angular's modern control flow (`@if`).
- Improved modal component internal DOM rendering architecture by utilizing standard `document.activeElement` operations with boundaries mapping.
